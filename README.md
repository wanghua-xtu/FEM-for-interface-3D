# FEM-for-interface-3D
We propose a new finite element method designed to address three-dimensional interface problems. This method employs a quasi-uniform, unfitted mesh as the foundation for constructing the grid, which incorporates anisotropic tetrahedral, pyramidal, and prism elements near the interface.
