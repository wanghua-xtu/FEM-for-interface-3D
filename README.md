This program package references Professor Chen Long's IFEM Matlab package (primarily for its mesh generation functions and numerical integration functions), which can be downloaded from Professor Chen Long's homepage. The poissoninterface3D component is responsible for assembling the stiffness matrix and the right-hand side, and for solving the system of linear equations. Running the testorder file outputs the convergence order of the finite element solution under different norms.
